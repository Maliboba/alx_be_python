# Python Introduction Project  

This project contains basic Python scripts designed to demonstrate foundational programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and user input handling. Each script serves as a step towards building practical programming skills.  

## Scripts and Descriptions  

### `simple_interest.py`  
- **Description**: Calculates the simple interest earned on a principal amount using the formula `I = P × R × T`.  
- **Objective**: Demonstrates arithmetic operations and variable assignments.  

### `rectangle_area.py`  
- **Description**: Computes the area of a rectangle using the formula `Area = length × width`.  
- **Objective**: Reinforces multiplication and working with variables.  

### `hours_to_seconds.py`  
- **Description**: Converts a given number of hours into seconds by multiplying the hours by 3600.  
- **Objective**: Introduces practical arithmetic operations and conversions.  

### `future_age_calculator.py`  
- **Description**: Prompts the user to input their current age and calculates their age in the year 2050, assuming the current year is 2023.  
- **Objective**: Introduces user input handling and arithmetic operations.  

### `basic_operations.py`  
- **Description**: Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two predefined numbers and displays the results in a human-readable format.  
- **Objective**: Serves as an exercise in basic arithmetic operations and formatted output.
